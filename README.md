# ✨ Evaluation System For Explanation Models Based On ML Prediction Models ✨ 

In recent years, complicated machine learning algorithms are widely used that it’s difficult to understand why they made a decision for particular input. Providing explanations for the results of ML algorithms is essential for researchers and users to make responsible decisions in many areas. In the medicine field, this issue is especially important as it matter of the health situation of human beings.
Today there are explanation algorithms for prediction models that provide explanation of the results. These explanations help the expert to make decision in a successful way. In order to trust these explanations, there is a need to provide an evaluation of the explanation’s results for assuring that the models provide an explanation at a good level.
In this project, we want to provide this need and provide an evaluation of the explanatory models according to a number of different methods.
This project will focus on the development and research of innovative evaluation methods for explanation models (Explainability) for prediction models built by Machine Learning. We researched and developed different evaluation methods based on the faithfulness, consistency and robustness of different explanation models.
The main goal of thus research project is to develop evaluation method for explanation model results and to provide a visual way for researchers and users to rely on predictions and explanations results.
In order to present the outputs of the evaluations and the explanations, and to support the research we developed graphical user interface that will be used by researchers and simple users as well that will produce explanations and different evaluations to evaluate the explanation models and their results.

## Features

- Consistency Evaluation
